        </h1>Political Science-International Affairs
        <div class="subheading mb-5">My name is Pamela Contreras Ambrosio. I'm currently a 4th year Political Science major emphasizing International Affairs at the University of California Riverside. I am a transfer student from Cabrillo Community College that is located on the central coast of California. Transferring to the University of California Riverside was a bit of a challenge at first. Not only from the transition from a community college to a four year university, but also the location move. Though my community college community helped me with the transition to university, It was still a challenge to get comfortable around this new setting. What was also difficult was how I didn't know how different the atmosphere in Riverside was going to be compared to Watsonville, California. However the challenges, my experience has been amazing here in Riverside, CA, and I hope it continues to be so in the last couple months I have left here.
 <br><br>

        Spring 2020, I did an internship at the R'Garden at UC Riverside. It was a great experience given how different it was. One of the things I didn't expect to learn was to how to ride a tractor, but they were super helpful and thought me how to work a tractor. I was also able to learn about food insecurity, focusing on the students here at UC Riverside. <br><br>

        While going to Community College, I was also employed at Walgreens. Being my first job I believe that it taught me so much about work ethic. I worked at Walgreens for about two years and a half back in Watsonville, California. My official title throughout my whole time there was just Customer Service, but I didn't just do that when I was there. I was put in charge of the photo department given my fast learning skills I was able to learn everything thus is what put me in charge of the photo department. I would also be sent to the Pharmacy department a lot to help them out given how busy the would get. I think my experience at Walgreens was a good one because it helped me develop skills that I didn't know I was capable such as being a team player, and customer service. Though I knew what I signed up for when I applied I was still scared it was going to be more challenging than it really was. I was able to develop these skills fast and efficiently. I hope that the skills that I learned at this job will prosper at any other job environment place, and that I continue to learn.
